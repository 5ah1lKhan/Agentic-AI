1.Hallucination of "Output" and "Doc IDs": The LLM is generating fake "Output" sections, complete with doc_id and chunks. It's essentially pretending to have run the document_retriever tool and making up the results it would have received. This is a classic example of hallucination.

This is the most critical issue. Our agent hasn't actually executed the tool yet. The LLM is just generating text based on its training data, mimicking what it thinks a tool output should look like, rather than waiting for real external input.

2.Misinterpretation of "RAG": The content of the hallucinated "chunks" (e.g., "RAG is a system for managing requirements," "RAG status") suggests that the LLM is confusing "RAG" (Retrieval Augmented Generation) with a different common acronym, "RAG status" (Red, Amber, Green) often used in project management or IT Service Management. This is precisely what happened with your previous initialize_agent attempt and highlights a semantic misinterpretation by the LLM. It's likely very strong on general knowledge about "RAG status" from its training data.
